# homeserver
The ultimate docker powered reverse proxy homeserver!

This repoitory contains the docker-compose files, that I use in my homeserver setup.
Befor you use them you need to:

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose
2. Create a directory that contains all the files (I used /opt/containers)
3. Copy the files in your directory and start the containers

You may encounter some errors (missing networks, files, etc.).

I will try to answer questions if there are any, but keep in mind that this repository is created in retrospect, so I can't guarantee anything.

I do not recommend opening your network if you don't have at least some understanding of what you are doing. If you don't know what docker is and how it works, 
inform yourself first, it isn't much fun to fix errors otherwise.
